# Welcome to f0

f0 is a **zero-configuration** documentation platform designed for the AI era. It serves three consumers equally: humans reading in a browser, search engine crawlers, and AI agents consuming structured text.

## Getting Started

To get started with this documentation:

1. **Browse** — Use the sidebar to navigate sections
2. **Search** — Find content quickly (coming soon)
3. **API Access** — LLMs can consume `/llms.txt` for context

## Features

f0 provides a modern documentation experience:

- **Filesystem as CMS** — Your markdown files are the source of truth
- **Tri-brid Rendering** — Same content optimized for UI, SEO, and LLM
- **Zero Configuration** — Drop in markdown, get beautiful docs
- **Dark Mode** — Easy on the eyes, day or night

:::info

This is a sample callout box. Use `:::info`, `:::warning`, `:::error`, or `:::success` to highlight important information.
